### RECOMMENDATIONS
-Increase marketing and inventory support in high-performing regions (South and North) and explore growth strategies for low-performing regions (East and West).

-Investigate low-demand products (gloves, jackets, shirts, socks) and consider discontinuing or repositioning them. Focus on stocking and promoting best-sellers like shoes.

-Implement a loyalty program for high-spending customers and personalize marketing to boost retention and repeat purchases.

-Maximize sales during peak months (February, July) and create targeted campaigns for slower months (April, August) to ensure consistent revenue.
-Use cross-selling, upselling, and product bundles to raise average transaction values.

-Regularly monitor dashboards for trends and collect customer feedback to inform continuous improvement.


### Conclusion
The South region generates the highest revenue, contributing over 32% of total sales, followed by the North. This suggests that the company may benefit from focusing on sustaining and growing these regions while identifying strategies to improve performance in the East and West. Certain products, such as gloves, jackets, shirts, and socks, have no recorded sales, indicating potential issues with market demand, inventory management, or product positioning. These items may need further analysis to determine if they should be repositioned, marketed differently, or even phased out. The top five customers contribute significantly to total revenue, which highlights the importance of customer loyalty and high-value clientele. Targeted marketing strategies could be implemented to maintain and enhance relationships with these high-spending customers. Monthly sales patterns reveal peaks in February and July, indicating potential seasonality or successful promotional periods. Conversely, the drop in sales during April and August suggests an opportunity for targeted campaigns during these slower months to boost engagement and sales. With a total of 50,000 transactions and an average sale value of $29.25, the company demonstrates a stable transaction volume. However, there may be room to increase the average transaction value through cross-selling or upselling strategies.
